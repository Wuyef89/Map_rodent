The following BRT models and meta-models are supported by the data, and R code in the repository.

In this research, we integrated eight climate variables and twelve land variables, along with data on population density, gross domestic product (GDP), elevation, mammal richness, reporting effort, and rodent distribution, utilizing the boosted regression tree (BRT) model to predict the distribution patterns of rodents and rodent-borne diseases in China (see Method for data sources). During the BRT model training phase, we sourced climate data from average records for the years 1960, 1980, 2000, and 2020. We employed the full version of EarthEnv's global 1-kilometer consensus land cover dataset, which includes GlobCover (2005-06; v2.2), the MODIS land cover product (MCD12Q1; v051), GLC2000 (global product; v1.1), and DISCover (GLCC; v2). Population density and GDP statistics were derived from data collected in 1995. For the BRT model testing phase, we utilized climate data from 2020, a streamlined version of the land variables dataset (comprising GlobCover (2005-06; v2.2), the MODIS land cover product (MCD12Q1; v051), and GLC2000 (global product; v1.1)), as well as population density and GDP data from 2019. The variables of elevation, mammal richness, reporting effort, and rodent distribution were consistently preserved across both the training and testing datasets. 

Additionally, during the first stage of our analysis, we conducted a three-time repeated 5-fold cross-validation to eliminate predictors with relative importance values below 2%. This refinement ensured that the model focused on the most influential predictors.In the second stage, we performed a ten-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation using the filtered predictors to confirm the robustness and parsimony of the model's parameter estimates. For each predictor, we calculated the average relative importance, and for the overall model, we assessed performance by computing the average AUC across the ten repetitions.
